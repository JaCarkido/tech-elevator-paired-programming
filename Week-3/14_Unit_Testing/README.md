# Unit Testing - Pairs Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with opportunity to practice the art of [unit testing][what-is-unit-testing] a codebase that does not included any automated tests.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, students will understand:

* How to write unit tests in a "legacy" codebase.
* How unit testing can be used to identify errors and bugs that are not apparent.
* How to structure unit tests in an organized, readable format.
* Why unit tests are important.
* Why writing unit tests before fixing a bug is valuable.
* How to write readable unit tests.

## Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements

> Code without tests is **bad code**. It doesn't matter how well written it is; it doesn't matter how  pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse.”
~ Michael Feathers, _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_

Over the past several days, you wrote a lot of code that was tested manually. However, as we know now, this is not necessarily the most efficient approach to verifying that applications are working as expected. Your task will be to revisit the pair Polymorphism and Inheritance exercises you worked on and add unit tests to verify that the code is functioning as expected.

## Getting Started

* Import the `inheritance-exercises-pair` project into Eclipse.
* Create a test class for the class you are going to be testing. For instance, if you are testing the CheckingAccount class, you will create a class in the you will create a class in the test/java/com/techelevator directory called CheckingAccountTests.
* Write test methods in the test class to verify the class under test is working as expected.
* Fix bugs that you find in the methods you are testing. **Any bugs you fix must have supporting unit tests or the code will be considered incomplete.**
  
* OPTIONAL:  If you would like more practice, `import the polymorphism-exercises-pair` project or the inheritance-exercises-pair project into Eclipse and repeat the above for it (i.e. Craete unit tests for one or more of teh classes)

## Tips and Tricks

* On your journey as a software developer, you will often find that you have inherited code that is untested, brittle, and riddled with ~~bugs~~ opportunities. One of the best things you can do for your benefit and for the benefit of the teams you work with is to write unit tests for any code you are modifying. This will help to remove [broken windows][software-entropy], which ultimately makes for better software, which yields happier customers, which yields greater revenues for your company.
* While it might seem counter intuitive at first, unit testing will actually make you a faster developer. For instance, consider the command line applications you have worked on over the past few exercises. While it is possible to test these applications manually, it takes quite a bit of time to make a code change, start the application, click through the menus, manually review the results, and verify your code worked as expected. A unit test automates this effort, is repeatable, and is therefore more reliable. It is also faster. Get into the habit of writing good unit tests, and you will ship code faster and more reliably than developers who don't.
* Test methods should clearly state what is being tested in the method name. For instance, if you were to verify that an Add method returns 4 when it is passed 2 and 2, then the name of the test method should be something like `add_should_return_4_when_2_and_2_are_passed`. Yes, this is verbose, but verbose methods are preferred in unit tests, as they clearly articulate what is being tested.
* There are some [best practices you should follow when writing unit tests][unit-testing-best-practices].
