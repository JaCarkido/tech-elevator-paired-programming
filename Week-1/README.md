## Make Change

Write a command line program which prompts the user for the total bill, and the amount tendered. It should then display the change required.

Please enter the amount of the bill: 23.65 <br/>

The change required is 76.35

## Martian Weight

In case you've ever pondered how much you weight on Mars, here's the calculation:

    Wm = We* 0.378

where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth

Write a command line program which accepts a series of Earth weights from the user  
and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.

``` 
Enter a series of Earth weights (space-separated): 98 235 185

98 lbs.on Earth, is 37 lbs.on Mars. 
235 lbs.on Earth, is 88 lbs.on Mars.
185 lbs.on Earth, is 69 lbs.on Mars.
